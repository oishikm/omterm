# omterm
omterm - Oishik M Terminal
  
A simple wrapper around bash (or any other similar and/or compatible POSIX shell) to bring a simple terminal experience to the user.
  
Simplicity inspired by Steve Wozniak's WozMon. omterm however, of course, does not perform any machine code execution like WozMon. It is simply a wrapper around POSIX shells.
